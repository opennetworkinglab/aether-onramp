# Aether OnRamp

Aether OnRamp provides a low-overhead way to bring up a
Kubernetes cluster, deploy a 5G version of SD-Core on that
cluster, and then connect that Core to either an emulated 5G RAN
or a network of physical gNBs. (OnRamp also supports a 4G
configuration that connects physical eNBs.)

To download Aether OnRamp (and all the submodules it depends on),
type:

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/aether-onramp.git
```

Taking a quick look at your ``aether-onramp`` directory, you will
find the following.

1. The ``deps`` directory contains Ansible deployment
   specifications for all the Aether subsystems. Each of these
   subdirectories (e.g., ``deps/5gc``) is self-contained, but
   the Makefile in the main OnRamp directory imports the
   per-subsystem Makefiles, meaning all the steps required
   to install Aether can be (and typically should be) managed from
   this main directory.

2. File ``vars/main.yml`` defines all the Ansible variables you will
   potentially need to modify to specify your deployment scenario.
   This file is the union of all the per-component ``var/main.yml``
   files you find in the corresponding ``deps`` directory. This
    top-level variable file overrides the per-component files, so
   you will not need to modify the latter. The ``vars`` directory
   contains several variants of ``main.yml``, each tailored for a
   different deployment scenario, with the default ``main.yml``
   supporting the Quick Start deployment described below.

3. File ``hosts.ini`` specifies the set of servers (physical or
   virtual) that Ansible targets with various playbooks. The
   default version included with OnRamp is simplified to run
   everything on a single server (the one you've cloned the
   repo onto). Example multi-node inventories are commented out.

Aether OnRamp assumes Ansible is installed. (See the
[Aether Guide](https://docs.aetherproject.org/master/onramp/start.html#prep-environment)
for instructions on doing this, along with additional guidance if this
is your first attempt to install OnRamp.) Then, once you edit ``hosts.ini`` to
match your local details, type the following to verify the setup:

```
$ make aether-pingall
```

## Quick Start

Edit ``vars/main.yml`` to reflect your local scenario. For
the Quick Start deployment, this means setting variable
``data_iface`` to your server's network interface. Note there are
**two** lines that define this variable, one in the ``core`` section
and one in the ``gnbsim`` section. You also need to set the
IP address of the AMF (in the ``core`` section) to your server's
IP address.

You are now ready to install a one-node Kubernetes cluster. Type:

```
$ make aether-k8s-install
```

Once Kubernetes is running (which you can verify with ``kubectl``),
you are ready to intall the 5G version of SD-Core. Type:

```
$ make aether-5gc-install
```

Once the Core is running (which you can verify by using ``kubectl`` to
check the ``omec`` name space), you are ready to emulate a RAN
workload. Type:

```
$ make aether-gnbsim-install
$ make aether-gnbsim-run
```

The second command can be executed multiple times, where the
results of each run are saved in a file within the Docker container
running the test. You can access that file by typing:

```
$ docker exec -it gnbsim-1 cat summary.log
```

Finally, you can bring up the Aether Management Platform (AMP) to view
dashboards showing different aspects of Aether's runtime behavior. Type:

```
$ make aether-amp-install
```

You can access the dashboards for Aether's Runtime Control system and
Aether's Monitoring system at the following URLs:

```
http://<server_ip>:31194
http://<server_ip>:30950
```

You will probably want to rerun ``make aether-gnbsim-run`` to generate
trafffic for the monitoring system to display.

When you are ready to tear down your Quick Start deployment of Aether,
execute the following commands:

```
$ make aether-gnbsim-uninstall
$ make aether-amp-uninstall
$ make aether-5gc-uninstall
$ make aether-k8s-uninstall
```

Or alternatively:

```
$ make aether-uninstall
```

## Beyond Quick Start

Being able to support more complex configurations of Aether is whole
point of OnRamp. See the OnRamp documentation available as part of
the [Aether Guide](https://docs.aetherproject.org) for details.

You might also check the `vars` directory of this repo, where file
`main.yml` specifies global variables used to configure how Aether is
deployed. By default, it is configured for the Quick Start deployment.
The other files define other common configurations, any one of which
you can copy to `main.yml`, and then edit to account for your local
details. These alternative configurations are identified in the README.
